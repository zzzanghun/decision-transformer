        "1. The given data (grid map, the direction vector from the drone's current position to the target, the drone's current state, and the drone's predicted velocity up to 1.5 seconds) comes from the expert polynomial trajectory. Analyze this information comprehensively, but remember that the purpose is not to evaluate the trajectory's overall performance, but only to determine whether it is safe or efficient.",

        "2. Safety and efficiency are primarily determined from the obstacles and the provided predicted trajectory. The further the obstacles are from the provided predicted trajectory, the safer but less efficient the trajectory is, and the closer the obstacles are to the provided predicted trajectory, the more efficient but less safe the trajectory is.",

        "3. Safety and efficiency are also determined by the cosine similarity between the target direction vector, current velocity, and predicted velocity. The higher the cosine similarity, the more efficient the path is, and the lower the cosine similarity, the safer the path is.",

        "4. The trajectory is provided to the drone continuously, and the trajectory information provided to you now is just one of them. Therefore, remember that the current trajectory provided is not the final one, and the flight will continue beyond the currently provided trajectory.",

        "6. For reference, a very safe trajectory example scoring 0.1 and a very efficient trajectory example scoring 0.9 are provided. Keep in mind that if a trajectory has higher alignment with the target direction and predicted velocity but passes closer to obstacles, it can be considered a very efficient but less safe trajectory. Conversely, if it has lower alignment but maintains a greater distance from obstacles than a very efficient trajectory, it can be considered safer but less efficient. This distinction does not evaluate the trajectory's absolute performance but only its safety and efficiency characteristics."
